# Table 2: Common Ion Chart

## Overview

This chart summarizes common ions found in chemistry, including both positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions), as well as numeric prefixes used in chemical nomenclature.

## Key Knowledge Points

### 1. Common Positive Ions (Cations)

- **Monatomic Cations:** Elements that form only one type of positive ion (e.g., Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺).
- **Transition Metal Cations:** Elements that can form more than one positive ion, often with Roman numerals to indicate charge (e.g., Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺, Cu⁺/Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺/Pb⁴⁺).
- **Polyatomic Cations:** Less common, but include ions like NH₄⁺ (ammonium).

#### Example Table

| Name         | Formula | Charge | Alternate Name |
|--------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Sodium       | Na⁺     | +1     |               |
| Potassium    | K⁺      | +1     |               |
| Calcium      | Ca²⁺    | +2     |               |
| Iron (II)    | Fe²⁺    | +2     | ferrous       |
| Iron (III)   | Fe³⁺    | +3     | ferric        |
| Ammonium     | NH₄⁺    | +1     |               |
| Copper (I)   | Cu⁺     | +1     | cuprous       |
| Copper (II)  | Cu²⁺    | +2     | cupric        |
| Lead (II)    | Pb²⁺    | +2     | plumbous      |
| Lead (IV)    | Pb⁴⁺    | +4     | plumbic       |
| Mercury (I)  | Hg₂²⁺   | +2     | mercurous     |
| Mercury (II) | Hg²⁺    | +2     | mercuric      |

### 2. Common Negative Ions (Anions)

- **Monatomic Anions:** Single element ions ending with “-ide” (e.g., Cl⁻, O²⁻, S²⁻).
- **Polyatomic Anions:** Ions made of multiple atoms, often containing oxygen (oxyanions), such as NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻, CO₃²⁻, PO₄³⁻.
- **Naming:** Suffixes like “-ate” and “-ite” indicate different numbers of oxygen atoms.

#### Example Table

| Name                 | Formula   | Charge |
|----------------------|-----------|--------|
| Chloride             | Cl⁻       | -1     |
| Oxide                | O²⁻       | -2     |
| Sulfate              | SO₄²⁻     | -2     |
| Sulfite              | SO₃²⁻     | -2     |
| Nitrate              | NO₃⁻      | -1     |
| Nitrite              | NO₂⁻      | -1     |
| Carbonate            | CO₃²⁻     | -2     |
| Bicarbonate          | HCO₃⁻     | -1     |
| Phosphate            | PO₄³⁻     | -3     |
| Hydrogen Phosphate   | HPO₄²⁻    | -2     |
| Dihydrogen Phosphate | H₂PO₄⁻    | -1     |
| Acetate              | C₂H₃O₂⁻   | -1     |
| Cyanide              | CN⁻       | -1     |
| Permanganate         | MnO₄⁻     | -1     |

| mono-  | 1      |
| di-    | 2      |
| tri-   | 3      |
| tetra- | 4      |
| penta- | 5      |
| hexa-  | 6      |
| hepta- | 7      |
| octa-  | 8      |
| nona-  | 9      |
| deca-  | 10     |
