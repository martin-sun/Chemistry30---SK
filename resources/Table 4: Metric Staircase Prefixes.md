# Table 4: Metric Staircase/Prefixes

## Overview

This table summarizes the metric prefixes used for unit conversions in the metric system, as well as the relationships between different orders of magnitude. The "metric staircase" visually represents how to convert between units by multiplying or dividing by powers of 10.

## Metric Prefixes and Multiplication Factors

| Multiplication Factor | Prefix  | Symbol |
|----------------------:|:--------|:-------|
| 1,000,000,000 = 10⁹   | giga    | G      |
| 1,000,000 = 10⁶       | mega    | M      |
| 1,000 = 10³           | kilo    | k      |
| 100 = 10²             | hecto   | h      |
| 10 = 10¹              | deka    | da     |
| 1                     | (base)  |        |
| 0.1 = 10⁻¹            | deci    | d      |
| 0.01 = 10⁻²           | centi   | c      |
| 0.001 = 10⁻³          | milli   | m      |
| 0.000001 = 10⁻⁶       | micro   | μ      |
| 0.000000001 = 10⁻⁹    | nano    | n      |

## Key Knowledge Points

- **Metric conversions** are based on powers of 10.
- Moving up the staircase: multiply by 10 for each step.
- Moving down the staircase: divide by 10 for each step.
- Prefixes are used for all metric units (meter, gram, liter, etc.).

---

## Applications
- **Unit conversions:** Quickly convert between metric units using prefixes.
- **Scientific notation:** Understand and use scientific prefixes in calculations and measurements.
