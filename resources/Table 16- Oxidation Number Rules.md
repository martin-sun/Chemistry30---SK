# Table 16: Oxidation Number Rules

## Overview

This table summarizes the rules for assigning oxidation numbers (oxidation states) to elements in chemical compounds. Oxidation numbers are used to keep track of electron transfer in redox reactions and are essential for balancing redox equations.

## Oxidation Number Rules

1. **Pure Elements:**
   - The oxidation number of a pure element (not combined with other elements, and not as an ion) is **zero**.
   - Examples: Na (0), H₂ (0), O₂ (0), P₄ (0)

2. **Monatomic Ions:**
   - The oxidation number of a monatomic ion equals its charge.
   - Examples: Na⁺ (+1), Cl⁻ (−1), Mg²⁺ (+2), N³⁻ (−3)

3. **Hydrogen:**
   - The oxidation number of hydrogen is **+1** when bonded to nonmetals.
   - It is **−1** in metallic hydrides (e.g., NaH, BaH₂).
   - Examples: H in HCl (+1), H in NaH (−1), H in H₂S (+1)

4. **Oxygen:**
   - The oxidation number of oxygen is **−2** in most compounds.
   - **Exceptions:**
     - In peroxides (e.g., H₂O₂, Na₂O₂), oxygen is **−1**.
     - When combined with fluorine, oxygen is **+2** (e.g., OF₂).
   - Examples: O in MgO (−2), O in Na₂O (−2), O in Na₂O₂ (−1)

5. **Alkali Metals (Group 1):**
   - Always **+1** in compounds.

6. **Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2):**
   - Always **+2** in compounds.

7. **Halogens:**
   - Usually **−1** in binary compounds, except when combined with oxygen or other halogens of higher electronegativity.

| Compound | Element | Oxidation Number |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| NaCl     | Na      | +1               |
| NaCl     | Cl      | −1               |
| Mg₃N₂    | Mg      | +2               |
| Mg₃N₂    | N       | −3               |
| HCl      | H       | +1               |
| HCl      | Cl      | −1               |
| H₂S      | H       | +1               |
| H₂S      | S       | −2               |
| MgO      | Mg      | +2               |
| MgO      | O       | −2               |
| Na₂O₂    | Na      | +1               |
| Na₂O₂    | O       | −1               |

## Key Knowledge Points

- The sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is **zero**; in a polyatomic ion, it equals the ion's charge.
- Oxidation numbers help identify which atoms are oxidized or reduced in redox reactions.
- Assign oxidation numbers in the following order: Group 1 metals, Group 2 metals, fluorine, hydrogen, oxygen, then other elements.

## Applications
- **Balancing redox equations**
- **Identifying oxidation and reduction**
- **Predicting electron transfer in reactions**
