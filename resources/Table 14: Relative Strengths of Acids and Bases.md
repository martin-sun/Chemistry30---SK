# Table 14: Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases

## Overview

This table summarizes the relative strengths of common acids in aqueous solution at room temperature (25°C), listing their acid dissociation reactions and acid dissociation constants (Kₐ). The table also illustrates the relationship between acid and base strength: as acid strength increases (larger Kₐ), conjugate base strength decreases, and vice versa.

## Key Knowledge Points

- **Acid Strength:** Strong acids dissociate almost completely in water (large Kₐ), while weak acids dissociate only partially (small Kₐ).
- **Base Strength:** The stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base.
- **Kₐ (Acid Dissociation Constant):** Quantifies the extent of acid dissociation in water; higher Kₐ means a stronger acid.
- **Relative Position:** Acids are arranged from strongest (top) to weakest (bottom). The trend is reversed for their conjugate bases.
