# Table 12: Solubility Chart

## Overview

This table presents a solubility graph for several common ionic compounds, showing how their solubility in water (grams per 100 cm³, equivalent to 100 g) changes with temperature (°C). Such charts are essential for understanding solution preparation, crystallization, and the temperature dependence of solubility.

## Key Knowledge Points

- **Most solids become more soluble as temperature increases.**
- **Each compound has a unique solubility curve.**
- **Solubility is measured as grams of solute per 100 g (or 100 cm³) of water.**

## Applications
- **Predicting crystallization:** Cooling a solution may cause crystals to form if solubility drops.
- **Preparing saturated/unsaturated solutions:** Use the chart to determine how much solute will dissolve at a given temperature.
- **Lab work:** Guides heating/cooling steps in solution preparation and purification.
