## Key Knowledge Points

- **Soluble ions:** All compounds of alkali metals (Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, etc.), ammonium (NH₄⁺), and nitrates (NO₃⁻) are soluble.
- **Low solubility exceptions:** Silver (Ag⁺), lead (Pb²⁺), and mercury (Hg₂²⁺) often form insoluble salts with halides and sulfates.
- **Sulfates:** Most are soluble, but those of Ca²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺, Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, Hg₂²⁺ are not.
- **Hydroxides, carbonates, phosphates, and sulfites:** Generally insoluble except with alkali metals and ammonium.
- **Definition:** A compound is considered soluble if it dissolves enough to give ion concentrations above 0.1 moles per liter at room temperature.

## Applications
- **Predicting Precipitates:** Use these rules to determine if a precipitate will form in double displacement reactions.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Solubility rules help identify ions in solution.
- **Laboratory Work:** Guides preparation of solutions and waste disposal.
