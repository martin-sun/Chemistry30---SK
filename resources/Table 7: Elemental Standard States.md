# Table 7: Elemental Standard States

## Overview

This table summarizes the standard physical states (solid, liquid, gas) of the elements at standard temperature and pressure (STP, 25°C and 1 atm). Understanding the standard state of each element is important for chemical equations, thermodynamic calculations, and laboratory work.

## Key Knowledge Points

### 1. Standard States at STP
- **Solid (yellow):** Most elements are solids at STP.
- **Liquid (blue):** Only two elements are liquids at STP:
  - Mercury (Hg)
  - Bromine (Br)
- **Gas (green):** Eleven elements are gases at STP:
  - Hydrogen (H₂)
  - Nitrogen (N₂)
  - Oxygen (O₂)
  - Fluorine (F₂)
  - Chlorine (Cl₂)
  - Helium (He)
  - Neon (Ne)
  - Argon (Ar)
  - Krypton (Kr)
  - Xenon (Xe)
  - Radon (Rn)

### 2. Notable Points
- **Most metals and metalloids** are solids at STP.
- **Noble gases** are all gases at STP.
- **Halogens:** Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, iodine is a solid.
- **Nonmetals:** Many are gases (H, N, O, F, Cl) or solids (C, P, S, Se, I).
- **Elements with atomic number >104**: Standard state is unknown due to short half-lives.

## Applications
- **Writing chemical equations:** Use the correct state symbol (s, l, g) for reactants and products.
- **Thermodynamics:** Standard enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy values are based on standard states.
- **Lab safety:** Knowing which elements are gases or liquids at room temperature is important for handling and storage.
