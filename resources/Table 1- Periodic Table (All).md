# Periodic Table of the Elements

## Overview

The periodic table is a systematic arrangement of all known chemical elements, organized by increasing atomic number. It provides essential information about each element and reveals periodic trends in their properties.

## Key Knowledge Points

### 1. Structure of the Table

- **Periods:** Horizontal rows (numbered 1–7) represent energy levels of electrons.
- **Groups/Families:** Vertical columns (numbered 1–18 or labeled with Roman numerals) group elements with similar chemical properties.

### 2. Element Information

Each element block typically contains:
- **Atomic Number:** Number of protons in the nucleus.
- **Element Symbol:** One- or two-letter abbreviation.
- **Element Name:** Full name of the element.
- **Atomic Mass:** Average mass of the element’s isotopes.

### 3. Major Categories

- **Metals:** Located on the left and center (e.g., Na, Fe, Cu).
- **Nonmetals:** Located on the right (e.g., O, N, Cl).
- **Metalloids:** Elements bordering the "staircase" (e.g., Si, As).
- **Noble Gases:** Group 18 (e.g., He, Ne, Ar), inert and rarely react.
- **Alkali Metals:** Group 1 (e.g., Li, Na, K), highly reactive.
- **Alkaline Earth Metals:** Group 2 (e.g., Mg, Ca).
- **Halogens:** Group 17 (e.g., F, Cl, Br), very reactive nonmetals.
- **Transition Metals:** Groups 3–12 (e.g., Fe, Cu, Zn).

### 4. Special Series

- **Lanthanides:** Elements 57–71, shown separately at the bottom.
- **Actinides:** Elements 89–103, also shown at the bottom.

### 5. Periodic Trends

- **Atomic Radius:** Generally decreases across a period, increases down a group.
- **Electronegativity:** Generally increases across a period, decreases down a group.
- **Ionization Energy:** Generally increases across a period, decreases down a group.

| 2             | He     | Helium    | 18 (VIIIA) | Noble Gas        |
| 11            | Na     | Sodium    | 1 (IA)     | Alkali Metal     |
| 17            | Cl     | Chlorine  | 17 (VIIA)  | Halogen          |
| 26            | Fe     | Iron      | 8 (VIIIB)  | Transition Metal |
