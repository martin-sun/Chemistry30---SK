# Table 20: Metal Activity Series

## Overview

The metal activity series arranges metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive to least reactive. This series helps predict the outcomes of single displacement reactions, corrosion, and extraction of metals from ores.

## Key Knowledge Points
- **Most reactive metals** (top): Readily lose electrons, easily oxidized, strong reducing agents.
- **Least reactive metals** (bottom): Resist oxidation, rarely react, often found in native form.
- **Displacement reactions:** A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its compound in solution.
- **Corrosion and extraction:** Reactivity series predicts corrosion tendency and guides metal extraction methods.

## Applications
- **Predicting single displacement reactions**
- **Understanding corrosion and metal protection**
- **Guiding extraction of metals from ores**
