# Oxidation Number Rules Cont.

## Additional Rules and Examples

5. **Sum of Oxidation Numbers in a Compound is Zero**
   - For any neutral compound, the sum of all oxidation numbers of the atoms must be zero.
   - **Example Calculations:**
     - **Mg₃N₂:**
       - Mg: +2 × 3 = +6
       - N: −3 × 2 = −6
       - **Sum:** 0
     - **Mn₂O₇:**
       - O: −2 × 7 = −14
       - Total for Mn must be +14 (to balance −14 from O)
       - Mn: +7 × 2 = +14
       - **Sum:** 0
     - **Cl₂O₃:**
       - Cl: +3 × 2 = +6
       - O: −2 × 3 = −6
       - **Sum:** 0

6. **Sum of Oxidation Numbers in a Polyatomic Ion Equals the Ion's Charge**
   - For polyatomic ions, the sum of the oxidation numbers equals the ion's overall charge.
   - **Example Calculations:**
     - **NO₃⁻:**
       - N: +5 × 1 = +5
       - O: −2 × 3 = −6
       - **Sum:** −1 (matches the ion charge)
     - **Cr₂O₇²⁻:**
       - O: −2 × 7 = −14
       - Total for Cr must be +12 (to balance −14 from O and −2 overall charge)
       - Cr: +6 × 2 = +12
       - **Sum:** −2 (matches the ion charge)
     - **SO₄²⁻:**
       - S: +6 × 1 = +6
       - O: −2 × 4 = −8
       - **Sum:** −2 (matches the ion charge)

## Key Knowledge Points
- Always check that the sum of oxidation numbers matches the total charge (zero for neutral compounds, equals the ion charge for polyatomic ions).
- Work backwards using known oxidation numbers (e.g., O is usually −2) to find unknowns.
- These rules are critical for analyzing and balancing redox reactions.

## Applications
- **Determining unknown oxidation numbers in complex compounds and ions**
- **Checking the correctness of assigned oxidation states**
- **Balancing redox equations in both neutral and ionic forms**
