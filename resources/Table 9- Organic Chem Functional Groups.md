## Key Knowledge Points

- **Alkane:** Only single bonds between carbons; saturated hydrocarbons.
- **Alkene:** At least one C=C double bond; unsaturated hydrocarbons.
- **Alkyne:** At least one C≡C triple bond; unsaturated hydrocarbons.
- **Benzene ring (phenyl):** Six-membered aromatic ring with delocalized electrons.
- **Alcohol:** Contains hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to a carbon.
- **Alkyl halide:** Contains a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached to a carbon.
- **Aldehyde:** Contains a carbonyl group (C=O) at the end of a carbon chain.
- **Ketone:** Contains a carbonyl group (C=O) within the carbon chain.
- **Ester:** Contains a carbonyl group adjacent to an ether linkage (COO).
- **Carboxylic acid:** Contains both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon.
