# Table 15: pH Ranges of Common Indicators

## Overview

This table summarizes the pH transition ranges and color changes of common acid-base indicators. Indicators are substances that change color depending on the pH of the solution, making them essential tools for titrations and pH measurements in the lab.

## Key Knowledge Points

- **Indicator selection:** Choose an indicator whose transition range matches the expected pH at the equivalence point in titration.
- **Color transitions:** Some indicators have gradual color changes, while others are more abrupt.
- **Application:** Used in acid-base titrations, pH measurement, and laboratory demonstrations.
