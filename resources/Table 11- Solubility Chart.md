# Table 11: Solubility Chart

## Overview

This table presents a solubility chart showing how the solubility of various ionic compounds in water (grams of solute per 100 g H₂O) changes with temperature (°C). Such charts are useful for predicting crystallization, preparing saturated solutions, and understanding temperature effects on solubility.

## Key Knowledge Points

- **Solubility increases with temperature for most solids:**
  - Examples: KNO₃, KClO₃, KCl, NaNO₃, NH₄Cl
- **Some salts have decreasing solubility with temperature:**
  - Example: NH₃ (ammonia)
- **Some salts show little change in solubility:**
  - Example: NaCl
- **Low-solubility salts:**
  - Example: Ca₂(SO₄)₃ (very low solubility, almost flat line)

## Applications
- **Predicting crystallization:** Cooling a solution may cause crystals to form if solubility drops.
- **Preparing saturated/unsaturated solutions:** Use the chart to determine how much solute will dissolve at a given temperature.
- **Lab work:** Guides heating/cooling steps in solution preparation and purification.
