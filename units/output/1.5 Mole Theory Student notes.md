### Definition of the Mole
A **mole** is the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12. This number is called **Avogadro's Number** ($N_A$), which is approximately $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles per mole.

- **Unit:** mol
- **Molar mass:** The mass of one mole of a substance (in grams), numerically equal to its atomic or molecular mass.

### Historical Context
Atomic weights were originally determined by comparing equal volumes of gases. According to **Avogadro's Hypothesis**, equal volumes of gases (at the same temperature and pressure) contain the same number of particles. This led to the concept of the mole.

### Avogadro's Number in Perspective
- A mole of paper sheets stacked would reach from Earth to Pluto.
- A mole of pennies laid side by side would stretch for a million light years.
- A mole of sand would cover a large portion of Canada to a depth of 2 meters.
- A mole of blood cells is more than the total number found in all humans on Earth.

### Calculating Molar Mass
The **molar mass** of an element or compound is the mass of one mole of that substance, expressed in grams per mole ($g/mol$). For compounds, sum the atomic masses of all atoms present.

#### Example: Calculate the molar mass of $Ca(NO_3)_2$
| Element | Number of Atoms | Atomic Mass (g/mol) | Total Mass (g/mol) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Ca      | 1               | 40.08              | 40.08              |
| N       | 2               | 14.01              | 28.02              |
| O       | 6               | 16.00              | 96.00              |
| **Total** |                 |                    | **166.10**         |

If the compound is a hydrate (contains water), add the mass of water molecules to the total molar mass.

### Calculations with the Mole

The mole allows us to relate mass, volume, and number of particles:

- **Mass:** $n = \frac{m}{M}$, where $n$ = moles, $m$ = mass (g), $M$ = molar mass ($g/mol$)
- **Volume (gas at STP):** $1$ mole $= 22.4$ L (at $0^\circ$C, $100$ kPa)
- **Volume (gas at SATP):** $1$ mole $= 24.8$ L (at $25^\circ$C, $100$ kPa)
- **Particles:** $1$ mole $= 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles (Avogadro's number)

#### Example Problems

1. **Molar Mass from Mass and Moles**
   - If $0.140$ mol of acetylene gas has a mass of $3.64$ g, what is its molar mass?
   - $M = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{3.64\ g}{0.140\ mol} = 26.0\ g/mol$

2. **Mass from Moles**
   - Calculate the mass of $35$ moles of $CaCO_3$.
   - $m = n \times M = 35\ mol \times 100.09\ g/mol = 3503.15\ g$

3. **Gas Volume to Molecules**
   - Calculate the number of molecules in $820$ L of $SO_2$ at SATP ($24.8$ L/mol).
   - $n = \frac{820\ L}{24.8\ L/mol} = 33.06\ mol$
   - Number of molecules $= 33.06\ mol \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}\ molecules/mol = 1.99 \times 10^{25}$ molecules

### Percentage Composition

**Percentage composition** is the percent by mass of each element in a compound.

#### Method 1: Using the Chemical Formula
- $\%\ \text{of element} = \frac{\text{mass of element in 1 mol}}{\text{molar mass of compound}} \times 100$

**Example:** Calculate the percentage composition of calcium chloride, $CaCl_2$.
- $M_{CaCl_2} = 40.08 + 2 \times 35.45 = 110.98\ g/mol$
- $\%\ Ca = \frac{40.08}{110.98} \times 100 = 36.12\%$
- $\%\ Cl = \frac{2 \times 35.45}{110.98} \times 100 = 63.88\%$

Chemistry 30: Unit 1 Review of Basic Principles
#### Method 2: Using Experimental Data
If the mass of each element in a sample is known, calculate the percentage by:
- $\%\ \text{of element} = \frac{\text{mass of element}}{\text{total mass of compound}} \times 100$

**Example:** A sample of an unknown gas contains $10.48$ g of nitrogen and $11.96$ g of oxygen. What is the percentage composition?
- Total mass $= 10.48 + 11.96 = 22.44$ g
- $\%\ N = \frac{10.48}{22.44} \times 100 = 46.7\%$
- $\%\ O = \frac{11.96}{22.44} \times 100 = 53.3\%$

### Challenge Problem: Isotopic Abundance

Potassium-40 ($^{40}K$) is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of potassium. Its percent natural abundance among potassium isotopes is $0.012\%$. How many $^{40}K$ atoms are in one cup of whole milk containing $371$ mg of potassium?

**Solution Outline:**
1. Convert $371$ mg K to grams: $371$ mg $= 0.371$ g
2. Moles of K: $n = \frac{0.371\ g}{39.10\ g/mol} = 0.00949\ mol$
3. Total K atoms: $0.00949\ mol \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 5.71 \times 10^{21}$ atoms
4. $^{40}K$ atoms: $5.71 \times 10^{21} \times 0.00012 = 6.85 \times 10^{17}$ atoms
