When using a formula (including keq), write down the formula then
substitute values with units. Show all of your work. Your answer must have
the correct units and significant figures in all of your final answers.

10. A certain amount of NO2 was initially put into a 5.00 L flask. When
equilibrium was attained according to the equation:
2NO(g) + O2(g) 4 2NO2(g),
The concentration of NO at equilibrium was 0.800 M. If Keq for this system is
24.0, what was the initial concentration of the NO2?
