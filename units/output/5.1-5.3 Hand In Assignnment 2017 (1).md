## 1. Graph Analysis
--------------------

Below you can see two graphs that show the concentration of the reactants and products as a function of time.  
**On each graph, draw a vertical line at the point at which equilibrium has been reached.**

### Graph a. Analysis:

* The first graph shows the concentration of HI (hydrogen iodide) and the combined concentration of H$_2$ (hydrogen) and I$_2$ (iodine) as a function of time.
* At the start, the concentration of HI is high while H$_2$ and I$_2$ are low. Over time, the concentration of HI decreases, while H$_2$ and I$_2$ increase.
* Eventually, all concentrations level off and become constant, indicating that equilibrium has been reached. The vertical line representing equilibrium would be drawn at the point where the curves flatten and remain parallel to the time axis.

### Graph b. Analysis:

* The second graph shows concentrations of three substances labeled A (red), B (green), and C (purple) over time.
* A starts at the highest concentration and decreases, B starts at a moderate concentration and also decreases, while C starts at zero and increases.
* All three curves become horizontal (constant) after a certain time, indicating equilibrium.
* The vertical line for equilibrium should be drawn at the point where all three curves become flat, showing no further change in concentration.

*In both graphs, equilibrium is visually identified as the moment when all concentration curves become horizontal, indicating that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal and the concentrations of all species remain constant over time.*

## 2. Equilibrium Expressions _(4 marks)_
--------------------------------------

Write the equilibrium expression for each of the following reactions. If you are not given a chemical equation, you must first write out a balanced chemical equation.

### a)

$$
4\,\mathrm{HCl}\,(aq) + \mathrm{O_2}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\,\mathrm{H_2O}\,(g) + 2\,\mathrm{Cl_2}\,(g)
$$

### b)

$$
5\,\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}\,(aq) + \mathrm{MnO_4^-}\,(aq) + 8\,\mathrm{H^+}\,(aq) \rightleftharpoons 5\,\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}\,(aq) + \mathrm{Mn^{2+}}\,(aq) + 4\,\mathrm{H_2O}\,(l)
$$

### c)

_Bromine and fluorine participate in a synthesis reaction to produce gaseous bromine pentafluoride._  
*(Write the balanced equation and equilibrium expression)*

## 3. Interpreting $K_{eq}$ Values
-------------------------------

For each of the following, state whether the value of the equilibrium constant favors the formation of reactants, products, or both sides equally. Explain, referencing the ratio of products to reactants, how you know.

* **a)** $K_{eq} = 45.0$
* **b)** $K_{eq} = 1$
* **c)** $K_{eq} = 2.1 \times 10^{-5}$

## 4. Application: Chlorine Decomposition
--------------------------------------

Molecular chlorine decomposes into atoms according to the reaction:

$$
\mathrm{Cl_2}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\,\mathrm{Cl}\,(g)
$$

The equilibrium constant for the reaction at 25°C is $1.4 \times 10^{-38}$. Would many chlorine atoms be present at this temperature? How do you know?

## 5. Data Table: Shift Reaction ($700\ \text{K}$)
---------------------------------------------

The following table gives some values for reactant and product equilibrium concentrations for 700K for the Shift reaction, an important method for the commercial production of hydrogen gas:

$$
\mathrm{CO}\,(g) + \mathrm{H_2O}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO_2}\,(g) + \mathrm{H_2}\,(g) + \text{heat}
$$

| Trial | [CO$_2$] | [H$_2$] | [CO]   | [H$_2$O] |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1     | 0.600   | 0.600  | 0.266  | 0.266    |
| 2     | 0.600   | 0.800  | 0.330  | 0.286    |
| 3     | 2.00    | 2.00   | 0.887  | 0.887    |
| 4     | 1.00    | 1.50   | 0.450  | 0.655    |
| 5     | 1.80    | 2.00   | 0.590  | 1.20     |

_All concentrations are in moles per litre._

> **Using the data, show that the ratio of the concentration of the products to that of the reactants, is a constant value at equilibrium.**

## 6. Calculate $K_{eq}$
----------------------

Calculate $K_{eq}$ for the following. The concentration of species at equilibrium is shown below:

$$
\mathrm{H_2}\,(g) + \mathrm{Cl_2}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\,\mathrm{HCl}\,(g)
$$

* $[\mathrm{H_2}] = 1.0 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{M}$
* $[\mathrm{Cl_2}] = 2.5 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{M}$
* $[\mathrm{HCl}] = 3.0 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{M}$

## 7. Reverse Reaction $K_{eq}$
---------------------------

The equilibrium constant for the equilibrium:

$$
\mathrm{CO}\,(g) + \mathrm{H_2O}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO_2}\,(g) + \mathrm{H_2}\,(g)
$$

is 302 at 600K. Show the $K_{eq}$ expression for the reverse reaction, then calculate the value of the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction at the same temperature.

## 8. Calculating Equilibrium Concentration
--------------------------------------

For the following reaction at equilibrium at 2000°C, the concentration of N$_2$ and O$_2$ are both 5.2 M:

$$
\mathrm{N_2}\,(g) + \mathrm{O_2}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\,\mathrm{NO}\,(g) \qquad K_{eq} = 6.2 \times 10^{-4}
$$

_Calculate the concentration of NO at equilibrium._

## 9. ICE Table: Sulfur Trioxide Formation
--------------------------------------

Sulfur dioxide forms sulfur trioxide according to the following equation:

$$
2\,\mathrm{SO_2}\,(g) + \mathrm{O_2}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\,\mathrm{SO_3}\,(g)
$$

If initially $[\mathrm{SO_2}] = 0.200\ \mathrm{M}$ and $[\mathrm{O_2}] = 0.250\ \mathrm{M}$, and at equilibrium $[\mathrm{SO_3}] = 0.130\ \mathrm{M}$, what is the equilibrium constant? 

**All mole-to-mole ratios that are not 1:1 must be shown.**

|          | SO$_2$ (M) | O$_2$ (M) | SO$_3$ (M) |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Initial  | 0.200      | 0.250     | 0           |
| Change   | -2x        | -x        | +2x         |
| Equil.   | 0.200-2x   | 0.250-x   | 0.130       |

## 10. ICE Table: NO$_2$ Formation
------------------------------

A certain amount of NO$_2$ was initially put into a 5.00 L flask. When equilibrium was attained according to the equation:

$$
2\,\mathrm{NO}\,(g) + \mathrm{O_2}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\,\mathrm{NO_2}\,(g)
$$

The concentration of NO at equilibrium was 0.800 M. If $K_{eq}$ for this system is 24.0, what was the initial concentration of the NO$_2$?

|          | NO (M) | O$_2$ (M) | NO$_2$ (M) |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Initial  |        |           |            |
| Change   |        |           |            |
| Equil.   | 0.800  |           |            |
