### Introduction to Stoichiometry
Stoichiometry is the process of using a balanced chemical equation to predict the amount of products that might form or reactants that might be used up. It literally means "to measure elements."

Chemical reactions provide two important pieces of information:
1. The type and number of atoms and molecules that interact and how they rearrange.
2. The relative number of moles of atoms and molecules that interact and form.

#### Example: Interpreting a Chemical Equation
**Balanced Equation:**
\[ H_2 + Cl_2 \rightarrow 2HCl \]
- 1 molecule of $H_2$ reacts with 1 molecule of $Cl_2$ to form 2 molecules of $HCl$.
- If you had 10 molecules of $H_2$ and 10 molecules of $Cl_2$, you would produce 20 molecules of $HCl$.
- If you had 1,000 molecules of $H_2$ and 1,000 molecules of $Cl_2$, you would produce 2,000 molecules of $HCl$.
- If you had 1 mole of $H_2$ and 1 mole of $Cl_2$, you would produce 2 moles of $HCl$.

**Key Ratios:**
- 2 moles of $HCl$ are produced for every 1 mole of $H_2$ consumed.
- 2 moles of $HCl$ are produced for every 1 mole of $Cl_2$ consumed.
- 1 mole of $H_2$ is consumed for every 1 mole of $Cl_2$ consumed.

**Analogy:**
If you have 2 suckers and 2 gummy bears, and you combine one of each to make a treat bag, you can make 2 treat bags. The limiting reactant determines the maximum product.

As you learned previously, moles can be converted to masses, volumes, or particles. Therefore, we can use a chemical reaction to calculate how much of a substance will form or react.

### Mole-to-Mole Stoichiometry
Mole-to-mole problems are skill-building exercises that help you practice using the molar ratios given by balanced chemical reactions. The mole ratio is a central conversion factor in all stoichiometric problems.

#### Example 1: Glucose and Oxygen
**Balanced Equation:**
\[ C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6H_2O + 6CO_2 \]

**Question:** How many moles of oxygen ($O_2$) are required to react completely with 3 moles of glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$)?

**Solution:**
- The coefficients tell us that 1 mole of glucose reacts with 6 moles of oxygen.
\[
3\ \text{mol}\ C_6H_{12}O_6 \times \frac{6\ \text{mol}\ O_2}{1\ \text{mol}\ C_6H_{12}O_6} = 18\ \text{mol}\ O_2
\]

#### Example 2: Fractional Amounts
**Question:** How many moles of $O_2$ are required to react completely with $0.25$ moles of glucose?
\[
0.25\ \text{mol}\ C_6H_{12}O_6 \times \frac{6\ \text{mol}\ O_2}{1\ \text{mol}\ C_6H_{12}O_6} = 1.5\ \text{mol}\ O_2
\]

#### Example 3: Decomposition of Potassium Chlorate
**Balanced Equation:**
\[ 2KClO_3 \rightarrow 2KCl + 3O_2 \]

**Question:** How many moles of $O_2$ are produced from the decomposition of $1.76$ moles of potassium chlorate?
\[
1.76\ \text{mol}\ KClO_3 \times \frac{3\ \text{mol}\ O_2}{2\ \text{mol}\ KClO_3} = 2.64\ \text{mol}\ O_2
\]

### Mass-to-Mass Stoichiometry
We can use a simple 3-step method to solve stoichiometric questions with balanced equations:
1. Identify the given and convert it to moles.
2. Use the mole ratio from the balanced equation to find moles of the desired substance.
3. Convert moles of the desired substance to the units asked for in the question (usually grams).

#### Example: Combustion of Methane
**Question:** What mass of methane gas in grams must burn to produce 365 grams of water?

**Balanced Equation:**
\[ CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow 2H_2O(g) + CO_2(g) \]

**Step 1:** Convert grams of $H_2O$ to moles:
\[
\text{Moles of } H_2O = \frac{365\ g}{18.02\ g/mol} = 20.25\ mol
\]
**Step 2:** Use mole ratio ($2\ H_2O : 1\ CH_4$):
\[
20.25\ mol\ H_2O \times \frac{1\ mol\ CH_4}{2\ mol\ H_2O} = 10.13\ mol\ CH_4
\]
**Step 3:** Convert moles of $CH_4$ to grams:
\[
10.13\ mol\ CH_4 \times 16.05\ g/mol = 162.6\ g\ CH_4
\]

### Gas Stoichiometry
The same mole method is used to solve questions involving gas volumes. At SATP (Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure), the molar volume is $24.8$ L/mol.

#### Example: Ammonia and Sulfuric Acid
**Question:** What mass of ammonium sulfate can be produced from 85 L of ammonia reacting according to the reaction below at SATP?

**Balanced Equation:**
\[ 2NH_3(g) + H_2SO_4(aq) \rightarrow (NH_4)_2SO_4(aq) \]

**Step 1:** Convert volume of $NH_3$ to moles:
\[
\text{Moles of } NH_3 = \frac{85\ L}{24.8\ L/mol} = 3.43\ mol
\]
**Step 2:** Use mole ratio ($2\ NH_3 : 1\ (NH_4)_2SO_4$):
\[
3.43\ mol\ NH_3 \times \frac{1\ mol\ (NH_4)_2SO_4}{2\ mol\ NH_3} = 1.72\ mol\ (NH_4)_2SO_4
\]
**Step 3:** Convert moles to grams (molar mass $(NH_4)_2SO_4 = 132.14$ g/mol):
\[
1.72\ mol \times 132.14\ g/mol = 227.3\ g
\]
