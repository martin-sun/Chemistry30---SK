Hydrocarbons are the simplest of all organic
compounds and contain ONLYcarbon and hydrogen
Types of Hydrocarbons
1. Alkanes: hydrocarbons with only single bonds between
atoms
ex) Butane C4 H10

Given the number of C atoms in an alkane, you can determine
the molecular formula by utilizing the following relationship
Cn H2n+2
Thus, a 13-carbon alkane has a molecular formula of:

Naming Alkanes
Branched-Chain Alkanes
Parent Chain: Longest continuous chain of atoms
Substituent Groups: All side branches
Steps:
1. Count and label the number of atoms in the parent chain
use this to determine parent chain name
2. Name each Alkyl substiuent group
name using the same prefixes as the parent chain, but the
ending becomes -yl instead of -ane
-methyl -ethyl -prophyl
-butyl
-pentyl

3. If the Alkyl group occurs more than once as a branch on the
parent structure, use a prefix (di, tri, tetra, etc) before its name
to indicate how many times it appears
4. Whenever different Alkyl groups are attached to the
same parent structure, place their names in alphabetical order
(do not consider prefixes)
5. Write the entire name using hyphens to separate numbers
from words and commas to separate numbers

## 3.2 Notes-Naming Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons are said to be SATURATED it contains
only single bonded. An UNSATURATED hydrocarbon has
at least 1 double and/or triple bonds
2. Alkenes: hydrocarbons that contain 1 or more doublebonds
H
ex: ethene
H
H
Given the number of C atoms in an alkene, you can determine
the molecular formula by utilizing the following relationship
Cn H2n
Thus, a 9-carbon alkene has a molecular formula of:

Naming to specify the location of the double bond in an
$ALKENE$
1. Use the same prefixes as when naming alkanes. However,
ending now becomes "ene" not "ane"
ex: Propene
9-
When there are more than 3 carbon atoms, we must specify
where the double bond is in the molecule.
ex) 1-Butene
VS.
2-Butene

## 3.2 Notes-Naming Hydrocarbons
***Numbering of the parent chain is determined by the
location of the double bond(s)
Branched Alkenes:
1. the parent chain is always the longest chain the contains a
double bond
2. the positions of the double bond determines how the chain is
numbered (not the branches) - give the carbons with the double
bond(s) the lowest numbers possible
3. The number of double bonds is denoted by prefixes (di,
tri,tetra, etc) before the suffix "ene"
4. Otherwise follow the same naming rules as alkanes

triple bonds
ex: ethyne (aka Acetylene)

the molecular formula by utilizing the following relationship

Naming an Alkyne is similar to naming an
alkene
1. Use the same strategies as when naming alkenes.
Only the suffix now becomes "yne" not "ene"

Properties of Hydrocarbons:
Hydrocarbons have predictable
properties determined by number
of atoms and type of bonds.
1. Alkanes:
Boiling point and melting point increase with number of C
atoms
e dissolve in nonpolar substances (as we know a C-H bond is
nonpolar)
have lower melting and boiling points than polar molecules
low reactivity (due to nonpolar and strong C-C and C-H bonds)
combust with oxygen (common fuel source)
