## 7.1 Virtual Redox Lab
Background
Oxidation and reduction reactions have been known for millennia but were not
understood until the 17th century. The terms come from metallurgy. Most metals do not
naturally exist in their metallic forms (except gold and silver), but were extracted from
rocks and minerals. As such the ores were "reduced" to a small amount of metal from a
large amount of ore. It was noted that the metals would react with oxygen and form a
new substance and hence were oxidized. We now understand that redox (oxidation-
reduction) reactions involve the transfer of electrons. Consider for instance, the reaction
between copper ions (Cu2+(aq)) and zinc metal (Zn(si) react according to the chemical
reaction:
Cu +2 +
$⇒$
+ Zn +2
(aq) Zh(s) CU/s)
(aq)
Electrons were exchanged in this reaction, making it a redox reaction. To make the
electron exchange more apparent, we can break this reaction into "half reactions".
$⇒ Zn*2 + 2e$
ZP(s)
(aq)
(zinc metal gives up electrons; hence zinc is oxidized)
$Cu +2 + 2 e ⇒$
(aq)
CU/s) (copper ion gains electrons; hence Cu2+ is reduced)
Another way of looking at the above reaction is to consider what the Cu2+ ion is doing
to the Zn. Cu2+ is causing the Zn to be oxidized, SO Cu2+ is acting as the oxidizing agent.
Conversely, Zn is causing Cu2+ to be reduced, SO Zn is a reducing agent. Reactions such
as that between Zn(s) and Cu?+ (aq) only go in one direction. In other words, we will not
see the following reaction occur:
+2
+2
CUs) + Zn (aq) -> Cu (aq) + ZP(s)
In other words, Zn is able to reduce Cu2+ but Cu is not able to reduce Zn2+. We can
summarize this by saying that Zn is a stronger reducing agent that Cu.
Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to order Cu, Mg, Zn and Pb from strongest to weakest reducing
agent.

Name:
The stockroom contains solutions of Cu2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Pb2+ ions and the
corresponding metals (Cu, Mg, Zn, Pb). Your first task is to order Cu, Mg, Zn and Pb from
stronger to weakest reducing agent. To do this, you need to obtain a beaker to mix a
solid metal with a known solution.
For example, ifl wanted to test whether Zn could reduce Cu2+, I would take 10 g of solid
zinc and place it in a beaker with 100ml of 0.10M CU(NO3)2. Using the concentration of
ions (seen on the right side of the webpage),Is see the following information:
Species
Molarity
H+
1.015e-7
$OH$
1.015e-7
Cu2+
-0
Zn2+
1.000e-1
250mL Beaker NO3
2.000e-1
You can see that I now have Zn2+ ions in my solution, but no Cu2+ ions. From this data, I
can conclude that Cu2+ was reduced (as there are no Cu2+ ions present) and Zn2+ was
oxidized (as there are now Zn2+ ions present and I didn't add any to my initial solution). =
By that same logic, if I wanted to test whether Cu could reduce Zn2+,lwould take 10 g
of solid copper and place it in a beaker with 100mL of 0.10M Zn(NO3)2. Using the
concentration of ions (seen on the right side of the webpage),Is see the following
information:
Species
Molarity
H+
1.005e-7
$OH$
1.005e-7
Zn2+
1.000e-1
Cu2+
-0
250mL Beaker NO3
2.000e-1
You can see that I do not have Cu2+ ions in my solution, but still have Zn2+ ions. From this
data, I can conclude that Zn2+ was not reduced and Cu was not oxidized (as there are
not any Cu2+ ions present). Thus, Zn is a stronger reducing agent than Cu.
Your task will be to mix all of the solids with all of the solutions to determine if a redox
reaction happens. If a reaction happens, write reaction in the data table below. If no
reaction occurs, write no reaction (see examples between the copper and zinc). You
will then use this data to order Cu, Mg, Zn, and Pb from strongest to weakest reducing
agent.
