Unit 4 Hand-In Assignment #1 (4.1-4.3)
Name:
This assignment covers sections 4.1-4.3. When writing solvation equations, make
sure you show all states for products and remember to balance the equation.
When using a formula, write down the formula then substitute values with units.
Your answer must have the correct units and significant figures in all of your
final answers.
1. Determine whether each of the following will undergo dissociation,
dissolving or ionization. Then write the solvation equation for each
substance:
a) Lithium oxide
