# Chemistry 30: 1.1 Scientific Math Review — Notes & Assignment

## Scientific Math Skills

### 1. Significant Figures
When measuring any value (time, mass, volume, length, etc.), you can never find the exact value. This is because you can always look at a smaller quantity within that measurement. In other words, you are limited by the accuracy of your measuring device.

> **Example:** Using a standard stopwatch, Donovan Bailey ran the 100 m race in 9.84 s.

It is possible to measure precisely but impossible to measure exactly. Every measurement comes with a certain degree of uncertainty. We must consider this uncertainty when performing math involving measurements so that we can report the correct precision in our answers.

A digit in a number that is measured is called a **significant figure** (it is meaningful). The more significant figures, the more precise a value is.

> **Example:**
> - One scale says a beaker is 97.53 g.
> - A second scale says the same beaker has a mass of 97.5295 g.

However, just because a digit appears in a number does not necessarily mean the digit is significant. Therefore, we use a set of rules to determine whether or not a digit is meaningful.

### Significant Figure Rules

**Rule 1:** Any non-zero digit in a value is significant.  
> Example: `56321` (all digits are significant, 5 sig figs)

**Rule 2:** Any zero between two non-zero digits is significant ("trapped zeroes").  
> Example: `4007` (4 sig figs), `2301` (4 sig figs), `40,208` (5 sig figs)

**Rule 3:** Any leading zero (to the left of all other non-zero digits) is not significant; these are just placeholders.  
> Example: `0.04` (1 sig fig), `0.0000000435` (3 sig figs)

**Rule 4:** Any trailing zero is only considered significant if there is a decimal point present.  
> Example: `50` (1 sig fig), `1300` (2 sig figs), `3.00` (3 sig figs)

> This last rule exists because numbers are often rounded to the nearest 10, 100, 1000, etc. Therefore, numbers like 50 can represent a range of values unless a decimal is shown.

### Handling Trailing Zeroes & Precision in Calculations

When writing numbers with trailing zeroes that you want to be significant, you have two options:

**Option 1:** Draw a line (overbar) over the last zero you want to be significant. This means all digits (including zeroes) to the left are significant.
> Example: Write 50 so it has two sig figs, or 1300 so it has four sig figs (e.g., $\overline{1300}$).

**Option 2:** Write the value in scientific notation.
> Example: $5.0 \times 10^1$ (two sig figs), $1.300 \times 10^3$ (four sig figs)

When performing math in this course, remember:
> **An answer can only be as precise as the least precise measurement used in the calculation.**

**Examples:**
- $4 \times 7.0$ (result has 1 sig fig)
- $9.00 / 3.0$ (result has 2 sig figs)
- $500 \times 0.01$ (result has 1 sig fig)
- $5076 + 12.3$ (result rounded to the least precise decimal place)

### 2. Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is a way to write very large or very small numbers concisely. For example, using the number 4.5 billion in a calculation is easier as $4.5 \times 10^9$ than writing out all the zeroes.

A number in scientific notation must follow these guidelines:
1. It is written as a product of two numbers.
2. The first number must have a value between 1 and 10.
3. The second number is a power of 10. If the overall number is greater than 1, the exponent is positive; if less than 1, the exponent is negative.

> Example: $3.28 \times 10^{-2}$ is in scientific notation, but $32.8 \times 10^{3}$ is not (should be $3.28 \times 10^{4}$).

When converting between scientific and standard notation:
- If the exponent is positive, move the decimal to the right.
- If the exponent is negative, move the decimal to the left.

### Scientific Notation: Practice and Calculator Use

**Convert the following to standard notation:**
- $7.588 \times 10^5 = 758,800$
- $5.347 \times 10^4 = 53,470$
- $2.5 \times 10^{100}$ (a very large number!)

**Write the following in scientific notation:**
- 7650 = $7.65 \times 10^3$
- 4.79 = $4.79 \times 10^0$
- 0.00567 = $5.67 \times 10^{-3}$
- 30 = $3.0 \times 10^1$

**Using Scientific Notation on Calculators:**
- To enter $2.88 \times 10^2$, press `2.88 EE 2` or `2.88 EXP 2` (EE/EXP means "times ten to the").
- This tells the calculator you are entering a single number, not a list of operations. Alternatively, you can use parentheses.

**Example Calculation:**
- $3.00 \times 10^{-8} + 9.51 \times 10^6$

> **Note:** Only the decimal number in scientific notation is counted for significant figures.

### Operations with Scientific Notation

#### Addition and Subtraction
Before adding or subtracting numbers in scientific notation, the exponents must be the same.

- **Not equal:**
  - $(3.4 \times 10^2) + (4.57 \times 10^3)$
  - Convert $3.4 \times 10^2$ to $0.34 \times 10^3$
  - $(0.34 \times 10^3) + (4.57 \times 10^3) = (0.34 + 4.57) \times 10^3 = 4.91 \times 10^3$

#### Multiplication
When multiplying, multiply the decimal numbers and add the exponents:
- $(2.00 \times 10^3) \times (4.00 \times 10^4) = (2.00 \times 4.00) \times 10^{3+4} = 8.00 \times 10^7$

#### Division
When dividing, divide the decimal numbers and subtract the exponents:
- $\frac{9.60 \times 10^7}{1.60 \times 10^4} = \frac{9.60}{1.60} \times 10^{7-4} = 6.00 \times 10^3$

### 3. Conversions and Dimensional Analysis

In science, there are many different units of measurement (inches, cm, m, L, mL, etc.). It is essential to communicate units for two reasons:
1. Everyone understands the measurement in the same way.
2. Measurements are used correctly in problem-solving.

> **Real-World Example:**
> In 1999, NASA lost a $125$ million Mars orbiter because half the project staff used imperial measurements and the other half used metric measurements.

Since there are so many units, we must learn how to convert between them. Scientists use the SI system (Système International), which is nearly identical to the metric system (meters, liters, etc.).

A helpful tool for metric conversions is the "Metric Staircase."

#### Example Conversions
- $28.6$ km = ______ m
- $23.4$ mHz = ______ MHz
- $12$ cm = ______ mm
- $18$ g = ______ dag
- $1.88 \times 10^3$ km = ______ m
- $3.26 \times 10^6$ mL = ______ kL

### SI Units & Dimensional Analysis

#### Common SI Units
| Measurement   | Unit      | Symbol |
|:-------------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Mass          | kilogram  | kg     |
| Volume        | litre     | L      |
| Length        | meter     | m      |
| Energy        | joule     | J      |
| Time          | second    | s      |
| Temperature   | kelvin    | K      |

If you are not converting within the metric system, **dimensional analysis** is very helpful! Dimensional analysis is the process of analyzing relationships between different physical quantities by tracking their units as calculations are performed.

> **Example:**
> - How many centimeters are in 6.00 inches? ($1\ \text{in} = 2.54\ \text{cm}$)
> - How many seconds are in 2.0 years?
