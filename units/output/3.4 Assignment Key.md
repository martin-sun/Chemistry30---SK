5. Explain why the hydration reaction involving 1-butene may yield two
distinct products whereas the hydration of 2-butene yields only 1 product.
hydrating 1-butene may yield 1-butanol or 2-butanol because the OH
group may bond to carbon 1 or 2 of the 4-carbon chain. hydrating 2
butene however, yields only 2-butanol
6. Explain the difference between an elimination reaction and a
condensation reaction. Which type of reaction best is best represented by
the following equation?
HO - CH,CH,CH,CH, - OH 1
+ H,0
Elimination reaction-one organic molecule loses atoms or groups of atoms
to form smaller molecules
Condensation reaction - two organic molecules combine to form a larger
one
Therefore, this one is elimination
7. Functional groups give organic compounds distinct properties that may
be used to identify the type of compound present. Suppose to examined
the properties of several compounds and made the following observations:
Compound 1-liquid that has a pungent odour. It is miscible with water and
the solution is a weak electrolyte.
Compound 2-is a liquid that has a strong aroma resembling apricots.
Using your observations, classify the functional group in each compound.
compound 1 - Carboxylic acid
compound 2 - ester
