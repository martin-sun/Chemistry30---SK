# Chemistry 30: 1.2 The Periodic Table â€” Assignment Key

Use the information in this section to answer the following questions. When finished, check your answers using the key provided below.

## 1. Valence Electrons and Reactivity
**a. How can the number of valence electrons help predict an atom's chemical reactivity?**  
Atoms strive for a full outer electron shell. They will react with other elements to either empty or fill their outer shells. If an atom's valence shell is nearly empty, it is easier (requires less energy) to lose electrons and thus is highly reactive. If the valence shell is nearly full, the atom is also highly reactive as it tends to gain electrons to complete the shell.

**b. Predict the relative reactivities of the following pairs based on their position in the periodic table:**
- Cs vs. Ba: **Cs is more reactive** (alkali metals are more reactive than alkaline earth metals).
- C vs. F: **F is more reactive** (halogens are highly reactive nonmetals).
- Na vs. Ar: **Na is more reactive** (Ar is a noble gas and very unreactive).
- Mg vs. Si: **Mg is more reactive** (metals are generally more reactive than metalloids/nonmetals in the same period).

## 2. Ionization Energy: Fluorine vs. Sulfur
**Why is it more difficult for fluorine to lose an electron than for sulfur?**  
Fluorine has a higher ionization energy than sulfur because of electron shielding. Electron shielding is the ability of inner electrons to shield the positively charged nucleus from the valence electrons. As you move right across a period, the number of protons increases but shielding does not, so the attraction for valence electrons increases. Thus, it is harder for fluorine to lose an electron than sulfur.

## 3. Potassium: First vs. Second Electron Removal
**Why is it easy to remove one electron from potassium, but very difficult to remove a second?**  
Removing the first electron from potassium empties its valence shell, resulting in a stable, full shell underneath. The next electron to be removed is from a lower, more tightly held shell, so it requires much more energy.

## 4. Ionization Energy: Indium vs. Aluminum
**Which has a higher ionization energy: indium (atomic number 49) or aluminum (atomic number 13)? Why?**  
Aluminum has a higher ionization energy because, although indium has more protons, it also has much more electron shielding due to its inner shells. This reduces the effective nuclear charge felt by the valence electrons, making them easier to remove compared to aluminum.

## 5. Predicting Properties of Element 119
**Scientists are trying to synthesize element 119. Based on periodic trends, predict two physical properties and one chemical property for element 119.**
- Physical: Likely to have a large atomic radius and low ionization energy.
- Chemical: Expected to be highly reactive (as an alkali metal).

## 1.2 The Periodic Table
$DLC_4$
Answers may vary, but possible properties include:
Physical: low electronegativity, large atomic radius, low ionization energy
Chemical: highly reactive
Challenge! Since atoms are mostly empty space, why don't objects pass through one another?
a) The nucleus of one atom repels that nucleus of another atom when it gets close
b) The electrons of the atoms repel one another when they get too close
C) the electrons of one atom attract the nucleus of a neighboring atom to form a barrier
a atoms actually do pass through one another, but only in the gaseous phase
