**Key Concept:**
- In a reversible reaction, products can reform reactants under the right conditions.

**Visual Description:**
- A graph shows the concentration of reactants decreasing and products increasing over time, eventually leveling off as equilibrium is reached.
- A diagram of a person juggling illustrates the idea of dynamic balance—balls are always moving, but the overall number in the air stays constant.

## Reversible Reactions

One common misconception is that chemical reactions only happen in one direction. In fact, many reactions are reversible—they can proceed both forward and backward under the right conditions.

- **Irreversible Example:** Frying an egg (cannot be undone).
- **Reversible Example:** Most physical changes, like melting and freezing, are reversible (physical equilibria).

**Chemical Example:**

- $2\mathrm{NO}_2 \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_4$

This means:
- The forward reaction: $2\mathrm{NO}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_4$
- The reverse reaction: $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_4 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{NO}_2$

We use a double arrow ($\rightleftharpoons$) to show that both reactions occur. The cycle continues as long as conditions allow.

- The **forward reaction** is when NO$_2$ is converted to N$_2$O$_4$.
- The **reverse reaction** is when N$_2$O$_4$ is converted back to NO$_2$.

**Note:** The forward reaction is always read left to right.

## Equilibrium

When a reversible reaction occurs in a closed system, it may reach a state called **equilibrium**.

**Example:**
If we add salt (NaCl) to water, we have the reversible reaction:

\[
\mathrm{NaCl}\,(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NaCl}\,(aq)
\]

- If we keep adding salt, eventually no more will dissolve and excess salt will remain at the bottom. This is a **saturated solution**.
- At this point, the rate at which NaCl dissolves equals the rate at which it crystallizes out of solution.

**Key Points:**
- At equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate:
  - Forward: $\mathrm{NaCl}\,(s) \rightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}\,(aq)$
  - Reverse: $\mathrm{NaCl}\,(aq) \rightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}\,(s)$
- No observable change in the amount of dissolved or undissolved salt, but particles are still moving at the microscopic level.
- This is called **dynamic equilibrium**: concentrations remain constant, but molecules continue to change places.
- **Important:** Equal rates, not equal concentrations!
- Different reactions take different amounts of time to reach equilibrium.

## Analogies for Equilibrium

- **Juggling Analogy:** Imagine juggling balls—balls are always moving, but the total number in the air stays the same. This is like dynamic equilibrium: constant movement, but no net change.
- **Sports Analogy:** Subbing players in and out of a game—players change, but the number on the field remains constant.

**Closed vs. Open Systems:**
- To reach equilibrium, the system must be **closed**—nothing enters or leaves.
- If you keep adding reactants and removing products at the same rate, you create a **steady state system** (like a factory assembly line), but not equilibrium, because the reverse reaction does not happen.

**Comparing Rates:**
- At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.

**Visual Description:**
- A graph shows the rate of the forward reaction decreasing and the reverse reaction increasing until they meet and become equal.
- Another graph shows the amounts of reactants decreasing and products increasing, both leveling off at equilibrium.

## Visualizing Equilibrium

**Graph 1:**
- *Forward Rate* (red) decreases over time
- *Reverse Rate* (blue) increases over time
- The rates become equal at equilibrium ("Equal Rates")

**Graph 2:**
- *Reactants* decrease and *Products* increase until both level off—no net change in amounts at equilibrium

**Important Definitions:**
- **Steady State:** An open system where some properties are constant, but equilibrium does not exist. There is a constant feeding of reactants and removal of products.
- **Dynamic Equilibrium:** A system in which change is constantly occurring at the microscopic level, but there is no net change overall.
- **Static State:** A system in which no obvious change is occurring at any level.

1. **Write reversible reactions for each situation (balance your equations):**
   - a. Hydrogen iodide gas (HI) decomposes into its elements:
     $$2\mathrm{HI}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_2\,(g) + \mathrm{I}_2\,(g)$$
   - b. Hydrogen and nitrogen gases combine to form ammonia gas, NH$_3$:

5. **Which of the following reactions are reversible?**
   - a. The evaporation of water (**reversible**)  
   - b. The combustion of coal (not reversible)  
   - c. The magnetization of an iron bar (**reversible**)  

6. **A chemist wishes to prepare pure phosgene (COCl$_2$) by reacting carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:**
   $$\mathrm{CO}\,(g) + \mathrm{Cl}_2\,(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{COCl}_2\,(g)$$
   - **Question:** Why will this reaction NOT produce pure phosgene? If the chemist could obtain a sample of pure COCl$_2$, would it remain pure? Why?
   - **Hint:** At equilibrium, both reactants and products are present. Removing only products disrupts equilibrium, and the reverse reaction can occur.

7. **Experiment: NO$_2$(g) and N$_2$O$_4$(g) Equilibrium**

   Two sealed tubes contain a mixture of red-brown NO$_2$(g) and colorless N$_2$O$_4$(g):
   - At room temperature, both tubes have identical medium red-brown color (equilibrium).
   - Heating one tube (boiling water): color becomes much darker red-brown (more NO$_2$).
   - Cooling one tube (dry ice, -78°C): color disappears (more N$_2$O$_4$).
   - Returning both tubes to room temperature: both return to original medium red-brown color.

   The reversible reaction is:
   $$\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_4\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\mathrm{NO}_2\,(g)$$

   **Questions:**
   - a. What evidence exists that the forward and reverse rates are equal at room temperature?
   - b. Can temperature changes affect an equilibrium reaction? How do you know?
   - c. What evidence shows the rates are equal at 100°C? If temperature is raised above 100°C, what would happen to the color?
   - d. The balanced equation should include "energy." Is the reaction exothermic or endothermic as written? Explain.
   - e. What gas is predominant at low temperatures? At high temperatures? Describe the composition at room temperature.
   - f. If one tube is filled with pure NO$_2$(g) and another with pure N$_2$O$_4$(g), what colors would you expect after a minute at the same temperature? What evidence supports your prediction?
