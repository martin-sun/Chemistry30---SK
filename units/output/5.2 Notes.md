## Introduction

- Some chemical systems have basically no reaction, while others readily go to completion.
- Most chemical systems fall somewhere in between these two extremes.

**Example Reaction:**

$$
\mathrm{H_{2(g)} + I_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2HI_{(g)}}
$$

### For a General Reaction

$$
aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD
$$

The equilibrium constant expression is:

$$
K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}
$$

- This relationship is true for all equilibrium systems.
- Another term for this equation is the **mass-action expression**.

### Example

For the equilibrium reaction:

$$
\mathrm{H_{2(g)} + I_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2HI_{(g)}}
$$

Find $K_{eq}$ if:

- $[\mathrm{H_2}] = 0.022\ \mathrm{M}$
- $[\mathrm{I_2}] = 0.022\ \mathrm{M}$
- $[\mathrm{HI}] = 0.156\ \mathrm{M}$

**Note:**

- $K_{eq}$ is constant for a reaction unless the temperature changes.
- Only the concentrations at equilibrium matter, not the initial concentrations.

## Experimental Data Example

For the reaction:

```

H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI

```

| Trial | [HI]  | [H₂]   | [I₂]   | Keq  |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ---- |
| 1     | 0.156 | 0.0220 | 0.0220 | 50.3 |
| 2     | 0.750 | 0.106  | 0.106  | 50.1 |
| 3     | 1.00  | 0.820  | 0.0242 | 50.4 |
| 4     | 1.00  | 0.0242 | 0.820  | 50.4 |
| 5     | 1.56  | 0.220  | 0.220  | 50.3 |

- Keq is always the same (ignoring experimental error) regardless of starting concentrations.
- **Only include gaseous and aqueous states** when calculating Keq. Do **not** include solids or liquids, as their concentrations are constant.

## Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Equilibria

- **Homogeneous Equilibrium:** All components in the same phase (e.g., all gases).
  - Example: `N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)`
  - Write the equilibrium expression for the above reaction.
- **Heterogeneous Equilibrium:** Components exist in more than one physical state.
  - Example: `2NaHCO₃(s) ⇌ Na₂CO₃(s) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(g)`
  - Write the equilibrium expression for the above reaction.

## What Does Keq Tell Us?

There are three main situations:

### 1. Keq is Very Large (> 10¹⁰)

- Product concentrations are much greater than reactant concentrations.
- The reaction essentially goes to completion (most reactants are converted to products).
- **Equilibrium lies to the right.**
- _Example_: Decomposition of ozone:
  - `2O₃(g) ⇌ 3O₂(g)` Keq = 2.0 × 10⁵⁷

### 2. Keq is Very Small (< 10⁻¹⁰)

- Product concentrations are much smaller than reactant concentrations.
- The reaction hardly occurs (most reactants remain unchanged).
- **Equilibrium lies to the left.**
- _Example_: Production of nitrogen monoxide:
  - `N₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2NO(g)` Keq = 1.0 × 10⁻²⁵

### Interpreting Intermediate $K_{eq}$ Values ($10^{-10} < K_{eq} < 10^{10}$)

When the equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$ is neither very large nor very small (i.e., $10^{-10} < K_{eq} < 10^{10}$), it means that at equilibrium, there are significant amounts of both reactants and products present. The reaction does not go to completion, nor does it barely proceed; instead, both sides are represented.

#### What does the value of $K_{eq}$ tell us?

- If $K_{eq} > 1$: There is more product than reactant at equilibrium. The system is **product-favored**.
- If $K_{eq} < 1$: There is more reactant than product at equilibrium. The system is **reactant-favored**.
- If $K_{eq} \approx 1$: Neither side is strongly favored; similar amounts of reactants and products are present.

#### Example:

$$
\mathrm{CO(g)} + \mathrm{H_2O(g)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO_2(g)} + \mathrm{H_2(g)} \qquad K_{eq} = 5.09 \; (\text{at 700 K})
$$

#### Graphical Interpretation

The diagrams typically show how the concentrations of reactants and products change over time as the system approaches equilibrium:

- **Axes:**

  - The horizontal axis represents **time**.
  - The vertical axis represents **concentration** of the species.

- **Product-Favored ($K > 1$):**

  - The curve for products rises and levels off at a higher concentration.
  - The curve for reactants falls and levels off at a lower concentration.
  - **Interpretation:** At equilibrium, more product is present than reactant.

- **Reactant-Favored ($K < 1$):**

  - The curve for reactants remains high, while the product curve stays low.
  - **Interpretation:** At equilibrium, more reactant is present than product.

- **Significance:**
  - The value of $K_{eq}$ tells you which side (products or reactants) is favored at equilibrium, but not how fast equilibrium is reached.

**Summary Table:**
| $K_{eq}$ Value | Favored at Equilibrium | Description |
|:--------------:|:---------------------:|:----------------------------------|
| $K_{eq} > 1$ | Products | More product than reactant |
| $K_{eq} < 1$ | Reactants | More reactant than product |
| $K_{eq} \approx 1$ | Neither | Comparable amounts of both |

a. `2NO₂(g) ⇌ N₂O₄(g)`
b. `N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)`
c. `H₂O(g) + C(s) ⇌ H₂(g) + CO(g)`

### 2. For the equilibrium system described by:

`2SO₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2SO₃(g)`
At a particular temperature, the equilibrium concentrations of SO₂, O₂, and SO₃ were 0.75 M, 0.30 M, and 0.15 M, respectively. Calculate the equilibrium constant, Keq, for the reaction.

### 3. For the equilibrium system:

`PCl₅(g) ⇌ PCl₃(g) + Cl₂(g)`
Keq = 35 at 487°C. If the concentrations of PCl₅ and PCl₃ are 0.015 M and 0.78 M, respectively, what is the concentration of Cl₂?

### 4. Find the concentration of the products for the following:

`NH₄Cl(s) ⇌ NH₃(g) + HCl(g)` when Keq = 6.0 × 10⁹

### 5. For the equilibrium reaction:

`CO(g) + H₂O(g) ⇌ CO₂(g) + H₂(g)`
The Keq value at 690°C = 10.0. A reaction mixture is analyzed and found to contain 0.80 M CO, 0.050 M H₂O, 0.50 M CO₂, and 0.40 M H₂. Show that the reaction is not at equilibrium.

### 6. For each of the following reactions, state whether the value of the equilibrium constant favors the formation of reactants or products:

a. `I₂(g) + Cl₂(g) ⇌ 2ICl(g)` Keq = 2 × 10⁶
b. `H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) ⇌ 2HCl(g)` Keq = 1.08
c. `I₂(g) ⇌ I(g) + I(g)` Keq = 3.8 × 10⁻⁷
