-Some chemical systems have basically no reaction, while others
readily go to completion. However, most chemical systems fall
somewhere in between these two extremes.
-Given the following chemical reaction; predict the number of moles of
product produced:
Hztg) + Izg 2HIg

## 5.2 - Equilibrium Constant - Keq
The Law of Chemical Equilibrium
-states that a chemical system may reach a point in which a particular ratio
of reactant and product concentrations has a constant value called the
equilibrium constant (Keq or K)
For a general reaction,
aA + bB 2 cC + dD
where a,b,c,d are balancing coefficients and A,B,C,D are substances, an
equilibrium constant (K eq) expression can be written as:
[CI X [DJ
$Keq =$
[AJ X [B]
This mathematical relationship is true for all equilibrium systems.
Another term for this equation is the mass-action expression.
Ex) For the equilibrium reaction
H2 + I2 222HI
find the equilibrium constant if [H 21 = 0.022 M, [I] = 0.022 M, and
$[HI] = 0.156 M.$
Since Keq is a constant for a reaction, it does not change unless the
temperature of the system changes.
It does not matter on the initial concentrations used to reach equilibrium,
just the concentrations at equilibrium.

Note that for this reaction, K eq is always the same (ignoring experimental
error) irrespective of the concentration of A, B, C, and D you started with.
When calculating K. eq for a given reaction, we do not include substances
in the liquid or solid phase.
This is because the concentrations of substances in these phases do not
change, but are constant no matter how much you have.
So, only include gaseous and aqueous states when calculating K eq*
Homogeneous and Hetergeneous Equilibria Constants
Homogeneous Equilibrium refers to a system with all components
in the same phase
ex: N2tg) + 3H2tg) 2 2NH3Ig)
Write the equilibriume expression for the above reaction:
Hetegeneous Equilibrium refers to a system with components that
exist is more than one physical state
ex: 2NaHCO36) 1 Na,CO36) + CO21g) + HOg
Write the equilibrium expression for the above reaction:

## 5.2 - Equilibrium Constant - Keq
What does Keg tell us?
There are 3 situations:
i. If Keq is very large:
The concentration of the products are much greater than the
concentration of the reactants. This means that the reaction essentially
goes to completion'. That is, all - or most of - the reactants are used up
to form the products.
Equilibrium lies to the right.
-We will call a number greater than 10 10 very large.
For example he decomposition of ozone, O 3
20318) 23028 Keq = 2.0 X 1057
ii. If Keq is very small:
The concentration of the products are much smaller than the
concentration of the reactants. This means the reaction does not occur
to a great extent. That is, most of the reactants remain unchanged
because only a few products are formed.
Equilibrium lies to the left.
-We will call a value less than 10 -10 very small.
For example, The production of nitrogen monoxide
N2g) + O2g) 3 2NOg
$Keq = 1.0 X 10-25$

iii. If Keq is neither very large or very small
This means that there significant amounts of both products and
reactants formed at equilibrium.
We call values between 10-10 and 1010 neither very large or very
small.
-Keg >1: a bit more product at equilibrium
-Keg>1: a bit more reactant at equilibrium
-Kg =1: neither is favored
For example, the reaction of carbon monoxide and water
COlg) + H,Og CO2 + H2 (g)
Keq = 5.09 (at 700 K)
