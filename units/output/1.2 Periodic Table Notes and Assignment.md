## 1.2 The Periodic Table
The periodic table is a fundamental tool in chemistry. It organizes all known chemical elements—both natural and synthetic—into a tabular format based on their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties.

- **Rows** are called periods and represent increasing atomic number.
- **Columns** are called groups or families and contain elements with similar chemical properties.

The periodic table allows scientists to:
- Predict chemical reactivity and properties of elements
- Understand trends such as atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity
- Classify elements as metals, nonmetals, or metalloids

The modern periodic table was first organized by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, who noticed recurring patterns (periodicity) among the elements.

### Structure and Function of the Periodic Table

The periodic table organizes all chemical elements—both natural and synthetic—into groups (columns) and periods (rows) based on their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties.

**Key features you can determine from the periodic table:**
- Atomic number (number of protons)
- Atomic mass (average mass of atoms)
- Number of valence electrons (relates to chemical reactivity and bonding)
- Physical state at standard conditions (solid, liquid, gas)
- Classification as metal, nonmetal, or metalloid

The arrangement of elements reveals repeating (periodic) trends in their properties, which are crucial for understanding and predicting chemical behavior.

### Periodic Trends
Periodic trends are specific patterns observed in the periodic table that illustrate how certain properties of elements change across periods and groups. Major periodic trends include:
- Electronegativity
- Ionization energy
- Atomic radius
- Melting point
- Metallic character

### Electronegativity

Electronegativity is a chemical property that describes an atom's ability to attract and bind with electrons in a chemical bond. It is a measure of how strongly an atom can pull electrons toward itself when forming a compound.

This property is related to the octet rule, which refers to the tendency of atoms to have eight electrons in their valence shell for stability.

The Pauling scale (named after Linus Pauling) provides unitless values to quantify the electronegativity of each atom.

**Trends in Electronegativity:**
- **Across a period (left to right):** Electronegativity increases. Atoms have more protons and a greater ability to attract electrons.
- **Down a group (top to bottom):** Electronegativity decreases. Atoms have more electron shells, so the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus and less tightly held.

> If the valence shell of an atom is less than half full, it requires less energy to lose an electron than to gain one. If the valence shell is more than half full, it is easier to pull an electron in than to donate one.

**Important exceptions:**
- Noble gases: Have a complete valence shell and do not usually attract electrons (no electronegativity values).
- Lanthanides and actinides: Have complex chemistry and do not follow general trends.
- Transition metals: Have electronegativity values, but there is little variance among them across periods and groups due to their metallic properties.

Ionization Energy Trend
Ionization energy is the energy required to: remove an electron from a neutral atom in it's gaseous phase
(essentially, it is the opposite of electronegativity). The lower the energy is, the easier the atom becomes
a cation
Trends:
1. The ionization energy of the elements within a period generally increases from left to right. This is due to
valence shell stability.
2. The ionization energy of the elements within a group generally decreases from top to bottom. This is due
to electron shielding.
3. The noble gases possess very high ionization energies because of their full valence shells as indicated: in
the graph. Note that helium has the highest ionization energy of all the elements.

Atomic Radii
The atomic radius is one-half the distance between nuclei of two atoms (just like the radius of a circle)
when covalently bonded together.
Trends:
1. Atomic radius decreases from left to right within a period. This is caused by the increase in the number of
protons and electrons across aj period. One proton has a greater effect than one electron; thus, electrons are
pulled towards the nucleus, resulting in a smaller radius.
2. Atomic radius increases from top to bottom within a group. This is caused by electron shielding.

Melting Point
Melting point is the amount of energy required to break a bond(s) to change the solid phase of a substance
to a liquid. Generally, the stronger the bond between the atoms of an element, the higher the energy
requirement in breaking that bond.
Trends:
1. Metals generally possess a high melting point.
2. Most non-metals possess low melting points.
3. Thei non-metal carbon possesses the highest boiling point of all the elements. The semi-metal boron also
possesses a high melting point.

Metallic Character
The metallic character of an element can be defined as how readily an atom can lose an electron and form a
positive cation (thereby making it act like a metal). Remember this trend when we talk about metallic
bonding in unit 2.
Trends:
1. Metallic characteristics decrease from left to right across a period. This is caused by the decrease in radius
of the atom which allows the outer electrons to ionize more: readily.
2. Metallic characteristics: increase down a group. Electron shielding causes the atomic radius to increase
thus the outer electrons ionizes more readily than electrons in smaller atoms.
3. Metallic character relates to the ability to. lose electrons, and nonmetallic character relates to the ability to
gain electrons.
** Another easier way to remember the trend of metallic character is:
Move left across period and down the group: increase metallic character (heading towards alkali and
alkaline metals)
-Move right across period and up the group: decrease metallic character (heading towards nonmetals like
noble gases)
