What volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid, containing 11.9 M hydrogen
chloride, is needed? MN, EMZN2

2. A chemist adds water to 120 mL of a 6.0 M solution of NaOH until the final
volume is 2.0 L. What is the molarity of the resulting solution?
MV. - Mzvz
(6oK0.21) - M2(2-OL
$Ma =0.036M NaoH)$
3. What concentration results when 150 mL of a 0.36 M solution of magnesium
sulfate, MgSO4, are added to enough water to give a final solution volume of
## 750 mL?
