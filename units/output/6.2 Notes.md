Conjugate acid-base pairs.
Conjugate acid-base pairs differ from each other by the presence or absence of a
single hydrogen ion (or proton).
Every acid has a conjugate base, and every base has a conjugate acid.
Ex) Write the conjugate bases for the following acids:
$HF$
$HSO_4$
Ex) Write the conjugate acids for the following bases:
PO,3-
SO42-
An acid in an aqueous solution always produces a species capable of producing a
base, A base in solution always produces a substance capable of acting as an acid.
Therefore, an acid-base equation contains an acid and a base for both the forward
and reverse reactions.

Polyprotic Acids
Some acids have more than one hydrogen ion they can give up. For
example, H2S04 has 2 H+ it can possibly give up.
The first hydrogen ion is released as:
H,SO4(ag) * H+ (aq) + HSO4ag)
The second hydrogen is more difficult to remove, but it can happen :
HSO4(ag) * H+ (aq) + SO:?(ag)
Each hydrogen you release after the first one gets progressively more
difficult to remove from these types of acids.
Acids that can donate more than one H + are called polyprotic.
Ex) Write all the equations showing the release of a H + ion for the acid
H3C6H507.

Strong and Weak Acids and Bases
A strong acid is identified as one that can produce many H+ (or H30+)
ions. Note the similarity between the definition of a strong electrolytic
solution.
Therefore, the stronger the acid, the more H+ ions are produced. On the
other hand, a weak acid produces few H+ ions.
Strong bases produce many OH- ions while weak bases produce few OH
ions.
Strong acids and bases produce one way reactions. That is the acid or base
breaks down completely to produce ions. At equilibrium, there are very
few reactants left concentration is low).

HC1 * H+ (aq) + Clag)
NaoH e Na'ag + OH(ag)
On the other hand, weak acids and bases do not ionize completely. For
weak electrolytes equilibrium lies on the left hand (reactant) side - there
are few ions present.

It is important to not confuse acid and base strength with dilution.
Dilute and concentrated refers to the relative amounts of solute and
solvent in a solution.
The acid and base strength refers specifically to the concentration of ions
in the solution.
A strong acid is still a strong acid even if it gets diluted. A weak acid is
still weak even when it is concentrated.

Ionization Constants
Since acid/base solutions are at equilibrium, we can write equilibrium
constant expressions for them.
equilibrium constants involving acids are known as Ka.
constants for base solutions will be denoted by Kb.
These values can be found in your resource package (Table 14).
Ex) Write the equilibrium constant expression for the acid or base in
solution.
HCLg) + H,O0  HO'ag + Clag)
NH3(ag) + H,Op 4 NH4'(ag) + OH(ag)
A large Ka indicates there are many H+ ions present. Therefore, this
indicates a strong acid.
A large Kb indicates a strong base.
Polyprotic acids:
-strength of the acid decreases with each H + ion removed.
