**Reminder: A base is a proton (H +) acceptor and an acid is a proton
donor.
A strong base readily accepts a proton.
Comparing the strength of acids and bases allows us to make predictions
about chemical reactions. (Referring to Table 14)
ex: When sodium bicarbonate and hydrofluoric acid are combined in an
aqueous solution, what reaction is likely to occur?
HCO, + HF
If we look at our table we can see that HF is a stronger acid than
HCO3 therefore HF will act as the acid in the reaction and give up
the proton
HCO3 + HF
H,CO,+F
base, acid,
acid, base,
In addition, the Ka and Kb values can help us determine hydronium and
hydroxide ion concentrations within a solution of weak acid or base.
Sony, Buddy, you
can't play BASEball,
youre an acid!

## 6.4 - Comparing the Strength of Acids and Bases
Finding ion concentrations for weak acids and bases require the
following approach.
Remember that if you look on your chart of strong and weak acids and
you see a small Ka value, you have a weak acid
Steps:
1. Write the balanced ionization or dissociation equation.
2. Find the Ka value from the relative strengths of acids and chart. Kb
values will be given in the question.
3. Use the equilibrium constant expression to solve for the
concentrations.
Note - the reason why we cannot use the same method for strong acids
and bases is because weak acids or bases do not completely ionize.
Ex) Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration in a 0.10 M acetic acid
solution.
Ex) Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration in a 0.025 M solution of
analine, C6HENH2 a weak base with Kb = 4.3 X 10-10.

Calculating [OH] in WEAK Acids and [H,0+] in WEAK Bases
Again, we: may be asked to find [OH 1 in an acid or the [H*] in a base.
Remember that we are calculating the ion concentrations for acid/base
solutions, which means they are mixed with water.
If we mix an acid with water, we are adding OH - to the acid because
water does ionize a bit. Therefore, we can use K w to calculate [OH].
Ex) What is [OH] for a 0.100 M solution of HNO,?
Likewise, if we are adding water to a base, we are actually adding H +
ions. We also use Kw to calculate [H;O*] in a basic solution.
Ex) What is the [H,O+] in a 0.025 M solution of NaOH (a strong base)?
Ex) For the last two examples, are the solutions acidic or basic?

## 6.4 - Comparing the Strength of Acids and Bases Assignment
Hint: check to see whether you are dealing with a strong or weak acid/base before starting the question.
1. Calculate [H*] in a 2.00 L solution of HCI in which 3.65 g of HCI is dissolved.
2. Calculate [H*] in a solution containing 3.20 8 of HNO3 in 250 mL of solution.
3. An acetic acid (HC,H3O2) solution is 0.25 M. Find [HO').
4. A 500.0 mL solution contains 12.0 8 of hydrofluoric acid. Calculate [H*].

5. When 1.22 8 of benzoic acid (CHSCOOH) is dissolved to make 1.00L of solution, the
resulting equilibrium [H*] = 8.0x104 M. Determine the K. of the acid. (Hint: think ICEBOX)
6. Calculate [H] and [OH] at 250 Ci in:
a. a 5.0 M NaOH solution. NaOH is a strong base.
b. a 0.025 M Ca(OH), solution. Ca(OH), is a strong base.
C. a 0.10 M. hypochlorous acid solution.
d. a 0.010 M Nitrous acid solution.
