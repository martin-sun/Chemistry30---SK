2. Identify the following compounds as a(n) alkane, alkane, alkyne, alcohol, aldehyde,
ketone, carboxylic acid, or an ester. (1 each)
a. A compound is found to be polar and acidic.
b. These compounds have an odor and are created by combining two other organic
molecules.
C. This type of compound contains only C single bonded to other C and H atoms.
d. These types of compounds are polar, which allows them to mix well with water, but they
are also very flammable.
