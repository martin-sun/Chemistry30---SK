## 2.1 ATOMIC STRUCTURE
## 2.1 Assignment
1. Chemical bonds are formed when atoms share, donate or accept electrons. In your own
words, explain how Dalton's, Thomson's and Rutherford's models do not allow for chemical
bonding.
Dalton's model- did not know about subatomic particles yet; therefore, there were no electrons to
bond
Thomson's "Plum Pudding" model- electrons and protons are scattered throughout the atom.
These particles would be attracted to one another and it would be hard to remove an electron
Rutherford's "Nuclear model"- getting there, but only one sphere around the nucleus would
become an issue as the number of electrons increase
Rutherford's "Solar System" > model- electrons would be attracted to the positive nucleus and would
cause the atom to collapse.
2. The Bohr model is useful for representing electron shells, however, this model has been
replaced by the Quantum Mechanical Model. Explain how this is more accurate
representation of the atom.
deBroglie and Schrodinger contributed to the quantum mechanical model. With these scientists
came the fact that electrons can act like a wave and a particle (wave-particle duality) and the
Schrodinger equation. This helps explain electron movement within an atom. Schrodinger also
used a mathematical equation to predict the location of an electron (resulting in the "cloud" or 3D
nature of the shell). The Bohr model assumed that electrons existed in specific energy levels and
moved in a 2D motion.
