## 5.5 Factors Affecting Chemical Equilibrium (Qualitative factors)
Many things can change a reaction rate (think about unit 4), but only three things have the
potential to change the forward and reverse reaction rates unequally. These three things are:
1. Change in Concentration
2. Change in Temperature
3. Change in Pressure (or Volume)
Changes that affect reaction rate but do not affect equilibrium are:
1. Adding a catalyst (or inhibitor): because it affects the forward and reverse reactions equally.
It just helps a reaction reach equilibrium sooner.
2. Change in surface area: also because it affects the forward and reverse reactions equally.
Le Chatelier's Principle
The French chemist Henri-Louis Le Chatelier is credited with first discovering ways to
change the equilibrium of a chemical system.
A system at equilibrium represents a delicate balance between the forward and reverse
reactions.
Small changes in external conditions can cause a shift in the equilibrium.
o A shift to the right means more products.
o A shift to the left means more reactants.
The system readjusts itself to accommodate the changes forced upon it and the
readjustments may alter concentrations.
Le Chatelier stated that an equilibrium system subjected to an external stress will shift SO as to
minimize the stress (or remain in equilibrium).
o A stress is anything changed in a system to upset the equiliorium concentration,
temperature or pressure/oolume).
Stresses:
1) Changes in Concentration
Adding a reactant or product will cause the equilibrium to shift in the opposite
direction to use up the extra material.
Taking away a reactant or product will cause the equilibrium to shift in the same
direction as the removal of material
Does not change Kc or Keq (which is a quantitative change)
2) Changes in Volume or Pressure
Gaseous systems are affected by volume and pressure changes but not solid or liquid
systems.
Volume and pressure changes will only affect equilibrium if the # of moles on the
product and reactant sides are different.
Does not change Kc or Keq
3) Changes in Temperature
The shift will be to minimize the stress
Shifts due to changes in temperature are dependent upon whether the system is
endothermic or exothermic.
Does change Kc or Keq
