Unit 4 Hand-In Assignment #2
This assignment covers sections 4.4-4.5. Make sure you show all states for
products and remember to balance equations. When using a formula, write down the
formula then substitute values with units. Your answer must have the correct
units and significant figures in all of your final answers.
1. What is the solubility of a saturated solution of:
a. Ammonium chloride at 800C in g/100mL of water. (1)
b. NH3 at 150C in mols/L water (show your work). (2)
2. You mix 20g of potassium nitrate with 100mL of water at 20Â°C. Describe
the solution in terms of saturation. (1)
3. There is more dissolved oxygen in the ocean the at greater depths when
compared to dissolved oxygen at the surface. Using Henry's Law, describe
this observation. (2)
4. State whether the following compounds are soluble or insoluble in water.
(3)
a. Sodium hydroxide
b. Ammonium acetate
C. Calcium sulfate
d. Lead (II) chloride
e. Potassium chloride
f. Calcium bromide

5. Why are spectator ions removed to form net ionic equations? (1)
6. Write the balanced chemical equation for the following reactions. Then
change each reaction to ionic form (if you need); finally to net ionic
equations (each is worth 2). If no reaction occurs, please include the
spectator ions.
a. FeSO4(ag) + (NH4)2S(aq) e
b. lead (II) nitrate and potassium bromide
C. KOH(aq) + NaClag) e
d. Pb(C,H02)2lag) + K2SO4(ag) *

each other in a common solution. Record your table, the order the
solutions must be added and the precipitate that forms at each step. (4
each)
