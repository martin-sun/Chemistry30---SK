When balancing the following redox reactions with oxidation numbers, the changes in
oxidation numbers must be shown and balancing coefficients placed into the equation
for full marks.
When using the half reaction method, you must fully write out both half reactions such
that the number of electrons in each is equal. Remember to put correct charges on
molecules and ions when appropriate.
1. Balance the following reactions using the oxidation number method.
a. NaCIO + H2S -
Nac1 + H2SO4
