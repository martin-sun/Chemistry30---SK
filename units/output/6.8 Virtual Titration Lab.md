## 6.8 Virtual Itration Lab
Background
Titrations are neutralization reactions used to determine the concentration of an acid or
base. For example, if you had a strong acid with an unknown concentration, you would
add strong base to it until all of the acid had been neutralized. At the very point that all
of the acid was gone, the amount of base that was added would be exactly equal to
the original quantity of acid.
Likewise, if you wanted to find the concentration of a base, you could neutralize it with
an acid of known concentration. The equation for titration calculations is:
$YMAVA = XMBVB$
MA = molarity of acid
MB = molarity of base
$VA = volume of acid$
$VB = volume of base$
Note: Any unit can be used for volume, as long as the same unit is used for the
volume of both acid and base.
In all titrations, an indicator is needed to determine when the acid or base has been
neutralized. Without an indicator, it would be impossible to determine when the titration
should stop. The exact amount of indicator used is unimportant, as it isn't directly
involved in the neutralization reaction. In this lab, the indicator we are using is
phenolthalien.
Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to carry out a titration experiment to determine the molar mass
of an unknown acid.
Procedure
There will be no set procedure for this lab activity. It will be up to you to design a
procedure and perform an experiment to determine the molar mass of a solid unknown
acid (hint: think about the topic in your 6.7 notes). Please note, it is important that you
record your data are you complete the lab to use in your calculations section.
All of the materials and equipment you need to carry out the lab can be found at the

Calculations
Based on the data you collected above, calculate the molar mass of the unknown
acid.
Check your answer by typing it into the bottom of the website.
Please enter your answer in the form below.
The unknown solid acid has a molar mass of:
grams/mole
and a pKa of:
Check
Please note, we do not learn about pKa in Chemistry 30, SO we are not calculating this.
However, to check your answer, a value must be put into the pKa box. Place any value you like
here.
You can. submit your answers up to three times. If all three answers are incorrect, you will be
given the correct answer and asked to reload the page and try a new problem. Good
Luck! Please be aware that reloading the page will result in having to start a new problem with a
differentunknown acid.
