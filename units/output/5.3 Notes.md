As we already know, a chemical equation tells us several pieces of
information.
H2 + I  2HI
This equation tells us how the number of molecules or moles of each
substance relate to each other by looking at the balancing coefficients.
The balancing coefficients also tell us how the concentration of each
substance changes as a reaction goes on.
For example, if [H,] changes by X mols/L, then [I,] changes by X mols/L,
and [HI] changes by 2x mols/L.
However, [H,] and [L] are decreasing while [HI] is increasing. Thus, we
say that A[H,] = A[I] = -X, and the A[HI] = 2x.
Note that the negatives mean decrease (or losing) and a positive value
means gaining.
This knowledge of changing concentrations is key for an ICE box
problem. The ICE is an acronym for:
I - Initial concentration
C - Change in concentration
E - Equilibrium concentration
An ICE box problem deals with initial con√ßentrations not at equilibrium.
Time passes, and equilibrium is eventually reached with new
concentrations kept in check by the equilibrium constant.
You can use an ICE box in any problem where you know some, but not all,
equilibrium concentrations

The following process can be used to solve an ICE box problem for a
general reaction: A + B  C
1. Balance the equation.
2. Set up the ICE box:
$AJ$

C
[Initial)
[Change]
[Equilibrium)
3. Use information. from the question to plug values into the ICE box.
It is the bottom row that we really want to use; the other rows in the
table just help get us there
Some hints you may want to consider:
i. Initially, you should have no product for the forward reaction.
ii. Balanced coefficients (mole to mole ratios) can help you
determine unknown values in the "C" column.
$iii. E=I-C$
Ex) Ammonia is created by the following process:
Nzg + 3Hzg  2 NH3
If the initially [N] = 0.96 M and [H,] = 0.72 M, and at equilibrium
[NH,] = 0.24 M what is the equilibrium constant?

iii. If Keq is known, but you do not know [product] then let one of the
changes in equilibrium equal X to solve for the missing
concentrations at equilibrium.
