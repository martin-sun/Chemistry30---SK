# 5.1 – Reversible Reactions and Equilibrium KEY

## 5.1 Assignment Key

### 1. Write reversible reactions for each of the following situations (be sure to balance your equations):

**a. Hydrogen iodide gas (HI) decomposes into its elements.**

$$
2\mathrm{HI}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{I}_2\,(g) + \mathrm{H}_2\,(g)
$$

**b. Hydrogen and nitrogen gases combine to form ammonia gas, NH$_3$.**

$$
\mathrm{N}_2\,(g) + 3\mathrm{H}_2\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\mathrm{NH}_3\,(g)
$$

### 2. If the system represented by the following equation is found to be at equilibrium at a specific temperature, which of the following statements is true? Explain your answers.

$$
\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}\,(g) + \mathrm{CO}\,(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_2\,(g) + \mathrm{CO}_2\,(g)
$$

- a. All species must be present in the same concentration.  
- b. **The rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. (TRUE)**  
- c. We can measure continual changes in the reactant concentrations.

**Explanation:** At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, but the concentrations of reactants and products are not necessarily the same.

### 3. Which of the following are equilibrium systems and which are steady state systems?

- a. A playing football team and a bench of reserve players. The number of players on the field is constant and the number of players on the bench is constant. (**EQUILIBRIUM**)
- b. A well-fed tiger in a cage. The weight of the tiger is constant. (**STEADY STATE**)
- c. The Nipawin Dam and Codette Lake behind the dam. The water level is constant. (**STEADY STATE**)
- d. The liquid alcohol and alcohol vapor in a thermometer. The temperature is constant. (**EQUILIBRIUM**)
- e. A block of wood floating on water. (**STEADY STATE**)

### 6. A chemist wishes to prepare pure phosgene (COCl$_2$) by reacting carbon monoxide and chlorine gas:
$$
\mathrm{CO}\,(g) + \mathrm{Cl}_2\,(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{COCl}_2\,(g)
$$
**Why will this reaction NOT produce pure phosgene? If the chemist could somehow obtain a sample of pure COCl$_2$, would it remain pure? Why?**

- It will NOT produce pure phosgene because the product will begin breaking down as soon as it is produced, since the reaction is reversible. Even if pure COCl$_2$ is obtained, it will not remain pure because equilibrium can be approached from either the reactants or the products.

### 7. NO$_2$(g) and N$_2$O$_4$(g) Equilibrium Experiment

**Reaction:**
$$
\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_4\,(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\mathrm{NO}_2\,(g)
$$

**a. What evidence exists that the forward and reverse rates are equal at room temperature?**
- The color does not change; NO$_2$(g) is being made at the same rate that it is destroyed.

**b. Can temperature changes affect an equilibrium reaction? How do you know this?**
- Yes, temperature CAN affect equilibrium. The color becomes lighter or darker when the temperature is changed, meaning more or less NO$_2$(g) is present.

**c. What evidence shows the rates are equal at 100°C? If temperature is raised above 100°C, what would happen to the color?**
- The color does not change while the tube of gas remains at a constant 100°C. If the temperature is raised above 100°C, the color would become very dark red-brown.

**d. The balanced equation should include "energy." Is the reaction exothermic or endothermic as written? Explain.**
- The reaction is endothermic as written:  
  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}_4\,(g) + \text{energy} \rightleftharpoons 2\mathrm{NO}_2\,(g)$  
  As heat is added, the forward reaction occurs to a greater extent and produces more red-brown NO$_2$(g), which is exactly what is observed.

**e. What gas predominates at low temperatures? At high temperatures? Describe the composition at room temperature.**
- N$_2$O$_4$(g) predominates at low temperatures (colorless).
- NO$_2$(g) predominates at high temperatures (dark red-brown).
- At room temperature, the tube contains a mixture of NO$_2$(g) and N$_2$O$_4$(g).

**f. If one tube is filled with pure NO$_2$(g) and another with pure N$_2$O$_4$(g), what would you expect after a minute at the same temperature?**
- The tubes should become the same color. A tube containing mostly N$_2$O$_4$(g) at low temperature and another containing mostly NO$_2$(g) at high temperature will eventually reach the same color at room temperature, indicating equilibrium.
