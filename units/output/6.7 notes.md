6.7. - Titration Curves
Titration curves are plotted to show the relationship between the pH of
the original substance as the titrator is added. This titrating substance is
called a titrant.
A titration curve looks differently if you are titrating an acid VS a base. It
will also look different if you are titrating a weak substance VS a strong
substance.
In general the titrant will always be strong. That is, regardless of the
strength of your original substance, the substance used to neutralize it will be
strong.
Strong Acid - Base Titration
The simplest titration is when we have a strong acid and we are titrating
with a strong base, or vice versa.
We will look at titrating 1.00 L of 1.00 M HCI with 1.00 M NaOH. Both
strong substances. The 1.00 M HC1 initially has a pH of 0. After the
titration, the solution will have a pH closer to 14.
Initially, the HC1 ionizes completely: HC1 (ag)
H+ (aq) + Clag)
We alsol know that we want to add some volume of! NaOH inc order to
make the [OH-] = [H*].
The NaOH is also completely dissociated: NaOH (aq)
Na* (aq) + OH (ag)
When this happens with strong and strong titrations the pH at the
equivalency point will always equal 7.

## 6.7 - Titration Curves
The curve will look similar if we are titrating a strong base with a strong
acid.
So, this time, let's imagine titrating 1.50 L of 1.00 M NaOH with an
unknown concentration of HCI. Use the graph below to determine the
[HCI).

Weak Acid/Base Titration
Remember, even if we start off with a weak acid we will titrate with a
strong base.
The reason why this situation will look different on our graph is due to
the properties of the ions initially in our solution.
HF (aq)
H+ (ag) + F (aq)
Because the F- accepts the H+ to form HF for the reverse: reaction, it has basic
properties.
As NaOH is added to the system, the OH - ions will seek out the H* - ions and
neutralize them.
Le Chatelier's principle states that if H + is being removed, then HF will ionize
more to replace the H+. This also increases [F 1 which will increase the pH
(because this acts as a base).
Eventually, all the H* + will be removed by the addition of OH : This
only happens once all of the HF is ionized. The presence of the F at the
equivalency point leaves the solution slightly basic.

## 6.7 - Titration Curves
If a weak base is titrated by a strong acid, we will get a similar curve.
This time, the weak base will have an ion in the solution with acidic
properties.
For example, we will titrate NH 3 with HCI.
NHlag) + H,Op 1 NH (ag) + OH (ag)
When the HCI is introduced, the H + ions will seek out the OH ions and get rid
of them. This will cause: more NH 3 to dissolve and create more NH,+.
This ammonium ion acts as an acid because the reverse reaction shows
NH, donating a proton to OH.
This excess of NHwill leave the solution slightly acidic.

Polyprotic Acids
When titrating a polyprotic acid, you are essentially titrating two acids at
once.
The curve shows the same trend as a weak acid titration where the pH
does not change for a while, spikes up and levels off again. The
difference occurs when the second acid reaction is taking place. The
same curve happens again where a slow change in pH is followed by a
spike and leveling off.
